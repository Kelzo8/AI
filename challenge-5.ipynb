        "Your model should include:\n",
        "- An **Embedding** layer (with a specified `padding_idx`)\n",
        "- An **LSTM** layer (with `batch_first=True`)\n",
        "- A **Fully Connected (fc)** layer to map the final hidden state to the output\n",

        "1. **Data Preprocessing & DataLoader Setup** (2 points):  \n",
        "   Import the YelpReviewPolarity dataset, tokenize the text, build a vocabulary, and create a DataLoader to supply batches to your model.\n",

        "   Implement a class that builds and returns the RNN classifier model using the parameters provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Training and evaluating the model** (2 points):  \n",

        "\n",

        "   Answer three questions (in markdown) about your implementation and key concepts.\n",

        "This challenge will <span style=\"color: red\">not work properly on Codespaces</span> because of the lack of GPU and pytorch support (at least I haven't figured out the setup yet). So for this challenge, you will open your repository's notebook in Google Collab and continue. You can do so by clicking the \"Open in Collab\" badge below and opening this notebook from your repository there.\n",
